* Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.


* Create React App doesn’t handle backend logic or databases; it just creates a frontend build pipeline, so you can use it with any backend you want. Under the hood, it uses Babel and webpack, but you don’t need to know anything about them.

* When you’re ready to deploy to production, running npm run build will create an optimized build of your app in the build folder. 


## Installation
* Create React App sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. 
* You’ll need to have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine.
* To know about how to install Node and npm, see the previous md.

 To create a project, run:

```
 npx create-react-app my-app
```
